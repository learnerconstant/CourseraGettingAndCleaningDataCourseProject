This repository contains a script to transform Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset to combine the training and test sets,
 extract mean and standard deviation of data measured, aggregate by the subject and activities to calculate the mean.

# Data
The script will generate a report that contains the mean of data grouped by the subject and six activities by measured by an accelerometer and a gyroscope contained in the original dataset.

# Transformation
The script does the following transformation:

1. Combine the training and test sets
2. Extract mean and standard deviation of data measured
3. Combine data with subject data
4. Change column names to human-readable feature names
5. Aggregate by the subject and activities to calculate the mean
